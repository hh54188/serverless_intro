  - BaaS: Serverless was first used to describe applications that significantly or fully incorporate third-party, cloud-hosted applications and services (Auth0)
  - FaaS: Serverless can also mean applications where server-side logic is still written by the application developer, but, unlike traditional architectures, itâ€™s run in stateless compute containers that are event-triggered, ephemeral (may only last for one invocation), and fully managed by a third party. (Firebase, AWS Lambda)
